# Text to CSV Converter

A Python script that converts a .txt file into a .csv file. 

Example of file containing nutritional data for fruits and vegetables. The dataset includes key vitamins (C, A, B, D, E, K), macronutrients, fiber, antioxidants, and other nutritional details. This repository is useful for conducting data analysis or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the nutritional contributions of fruits and vegetables, such as those beneficial in addressing malnutrition disorders like kwashiorkor.

The `.txt` file should be placed in the `input` folder, and the `.csv` output will be saved in the `output` folder.
    The contents of the file used in this code were created from scratch and were not the result of any study on the subject.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Instructions

1. Create two folders: `input` and `output` in the same directory as this script.
2. Place your `.txt` file in the `input` folder.
3. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python convert_txt_to_csv.py
